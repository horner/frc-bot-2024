# Bot 2024

## Driver Station Tuning

* [Driver Station Best Practices](https://frcdocs.wpi.edu/en/2022/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-best-practices.html)

## Example Code

FRC provides [several examples](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibcExamples/src/main/cpp/examples) of how to utilize WPIlib on GitHub.  It is easier, and faster to copy and paste from these rather than generate new projects all the time.

## Simulation
Bot simulation is available in a few ways...

### Basic Simulator
This is the data-based simulator panel.

```bash
# run this from the command line to start the basic simulator
./gradlew simulateNative
```
