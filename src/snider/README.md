# botlib Prototype area

We don't really have time to work the two out (lib and bot) independantly before
March.  So this is a prototyping area for the library and should depend only
on C++ itself.

After the first competion we can do a little mini project where we offload the
library code into the library, then re-import this stuff back in an official
manner.
